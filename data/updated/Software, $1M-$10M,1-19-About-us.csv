Cloze is like a personal assistant for your professional relationships that is always prompting you at the right moment and remembering what you don’t.

It pulls from your apps to automatically create one view of every person and company - all their contact details, and your complete history - every email back and forth, your phone calls together, your meetings, your notes on Evernote, documents you exchanged and your interactions on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. We’ll even grab email signatures so your contacts are always up-to-date.

It's all organized for you - by contact, company and meeting - without any busy work.

With everything in one place, Cloze can put advanced data science to work for you. Cloze figures out who is important and keeps them top of mind, and will even remind you to reach out to a contact and refresh a fading relationship.

Cloze organizes by companies too - without any setup. See your complete interaction history with any company, automatically in one place: contacts, email, meetings, phone calls, notes, documents and social media too.

There’s no data entry - Cloze is the automatic way to remember everyone.

We specialize in owner-operated businesses in the $10-$200 million range.

Our team is uniquely equipped to guide business owners because we are or have been business owners.  We have sat in the owner/CEO seat, had to make the same decisions, and have firsthand experience in the sale process.

Our core distinctive is an emphasis on transition instead of transaction. We emphasize candid business diagnostics & evaluation, clear-eyed consulting, and honest valuations leading to a successful outcome as defined by our clients.
 
For most business owners, the sale of their business is a once in a lifetime opportunity to capitalize on years, perhaps even generations, of work and sacrifice. You want to be surrounded by people you can trust, have the experience necessary, are available to you, and have your best interests in mind.

Important aspects of the sale process we lead:
* Optimize and protect operations during the sales process
* Stabilize business value by reducing owner dependence
* Determine business value anchors
* Secure and retain key personnel and contracts
* Maintain margin performance
* Operations risk mitigation
* Identify and memorialize processes and systems
* Protecting your employees and minimize community impact
* Identify strategic buyers who value the legacy and reputation of your company
* Understanding what you sell for vs what you keep, how to minimize tax liability 

Selling your company is like climbing Mt Everest without a guide. We are business Sherpas, walking alongside, showing you the safest, fastest, and best route because we have been here before. We guide you from the bottom of the mountain to the summit. Along the way, we will also point out the view, carry some of the load, and take a picture when you reach the top."

Imagine a world where all children have access to the education that works best for them, created just for them. Now imagine the company that plans to continuously improve the learning ecosystem to produce the best imaginable learning pathways for each student. Imagine inspired and engaged learning. That’s us. That’s Enlearn. http://www.enlearn.org/

The learning process is a composed of elaborately interconnected parts and interdependent variables related to the learner, the teacher, the curriculum, and the learning environment.  A small change in any one of these variables can significantly affect the overall ecosystem and subsequent student learning. Enlearn is that change. 

COMPANY BACKGROUND
Enlearn was founded in 2012 as a not-for-profit corporation with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to support data-driven optimization of the learning ecosystem, including optimization of student learning, teacher effectiveness, and courseware efficacy.

We’re developing the Enlearn Platform as a curriculum-agnostic platform that provides personalized and adaptive pathways. The data from this optimization process will provide a continuous formative assessment loop to help teachers target and refine their instruction to best meet individual student learning needs. The data also helps prioritize and shape product enhancements for curricula to maximize the learning impact of their products. 

Five years of research and development at the University of Washington’s Center for Game Science (CGS) lead to the initial Enlearn Platform. The CGS research is focused on the optimization of the interactive experience towards optimal learning outcomes, and was the basis for the game Foldit (among others) which produced world-class experts who, in under three years, published five research papers.

Providing the market’s only “in-video search” capability, Omedym empowers buyers to ask questions and be presented with the exact second of a video or line in a PDF that answers their question. This creates a convenient, informative, and efficient buying experience that compounds buyer engagement. 

Leading sales organizations use Omedym to provide each prospect with their own private and secure portal where videos and documents can be safely shared 24x7, and to gather extensive buyer intent + engagement data (automatically uploaded into their CRM) that feeds an AI engine to recommend actions to accelerate deals forward. Learn more here: https://www.omedym.com/sales

Modern Marketing teams use Omedym to increase pipeline generation and quality of leads by providing website visitors an alternative to requesting a demo. Omedym is embedded directly into their website, giving visitors the ability to ask questions and get immediate answers within your content, helping them get the information they need to engage with sales. Learn more here: https://www.omedym.com/marketingteams

Leading Customer Success teams provide customers with an on-demand location to get immediate answers to their questions rather than having to create a support ticket. Customers also have access to onboarding/training content and any exclusive materials (i.e. meeting recordings) to help speed up their time to value. Customer Success sees their customer’s engagement with the portal and knows if and when to intervene. Plus, Omedym customers report instances of automated upselling without lifting a finger.

By creating an extensive portfolio of patented and patent-pending hypervelocity technologies HyperSciences developed HyperCore, one of the world's fastest, simplest, and most efficient commercial launch systems. Utilizing artificial intelligence our system first robotically loads and fires objects, next our HyperCore engine continues the process to accelerates the object to velocities greater than Mach 5.

We are revolutionary changing the efficiencies and economics of drilling HyperSciences, since 2015 our company has been partnered with Shell Energy to demonstrate this disruptive technology. We use low-cost chemical energy to accelerate consumable projectiles to hypersonic velocities, allowing projectiles upon impact to break and pulverize hard rock faster, deeper, and through a wider range of conditions. 

We are using this same HyperCore technology to create the Hyper Tunneling Boring and Mining system (HTBM), replacing conventional tunneling methods which typically are slow, and significant capital expense. In most cases each consumable projectile removes over a half a ton of rock per impact. 

When applied to deep geothermal energy our drilling system allows for low-cost access to deep energy. Our ""Energy Anywhere"" geothermal system generates power by quickly and efficiently reaching untapped geothermal resources and converting it into electrical energy that will cause a significant paradigm change in renewable, clean energy. 

In 2018 HyperSciences secured our first contract with NASA by applying the key components of HyperCore's automated system in order to launch payloads to high-altitudes at extreme velocity. By lowering the cost for hypersonic vehicle development and a new type of stealth program our system is prepared to support USA government contracts in the aerospace community."

While she was there she would look for these crafts but noticed that they were slowly but surely disappearing and being replaced by mass-produced synthetic alternatives.

Jamie created Kayu as a way to connect to her childhood memories, as well as preserve indigeneous craft and provide artisans with a living wage. Over the past ten years Kayu has grown but its values and mission has remained the same; to create timeless personal and home accessories using the highest quality natural materials while leading the industry in sustainable and ethical production practices."

We work with organizations of all shapes and sizes—from early-stage startups to the world’s leading brands—to turn ideas into compelling products and experiences.

Alena Solutions was founded in 2016 by two best friends who were disillusioned with the standard (and broken) relationship between digital product agencies and their clients. The founders knew there must be a better way, so they launched Alena Solutions with the vision of creating engagements that blurred the lines between ""studio"" and ""client"" and delivered tangible value to all.

A live event in a Redpill virtual world is a spectacle filled with stunning computer-generated environments, accurate spatial music and VOIP, stylistic or photoreal gorgeous avatars which the fans or the performers can puppeteer organically, rich interactions, DMX-controlled light shows, audio lifeforms reacting to live music accompanied by live video feeds from the real world or a VJ. With Redpill sensor fusion and markerless tracking for DJs to optically tracked multi-performers for acrobats and dancers, physical performances will migrate to the virtual world. 

Fans can finally enjoy their favorite shows and artists, live, with their friends from across the globe.

We’re focused on clients using Microsoft Teams and Sharepoint.

Our clients set goals and experience results like these:
-- Reduction of 90% for internal emails, saving over 5 hrs/wk/employee
-- Business development team reacting 50% faster to prospect requests
-- Operational on-time project completion rate over 75%

Through our 4-step process, we help organizations and their leadership to design clear pathways for communications to travel between people and groups, using Microsoft Teams and M365.

Another challenge is getting team members to the files and data they need, faster. Unnecessary content and storage repositories that lack ownership are all distractions. The process of radically-simplifying removes the ""noise"",  reducing the number of files, chats, wikis and meeting data needed to move FAST on opportunities and projects.
 
A natural part of restructuring results in a healthier culture, more defined workflows and accessibility and permissions that make sense. Our process is ideal for companies experiencing rapid growth, M&A or any activity that requires rethinking file storage and communication inside the organization. 

By partnering with MSPs and IT providers across the US, we leverage our partners' abilities with Azure, security, support and infrastructure. Together, we're providing the right Microsoft tools and teaching clients to configure and use them effectively."

The Thynk Health platform optimizes data-driven workflows and provides operational and clinical analytics for lung cancer screening programs and other quality initiatives.

Thynk Health leverages artificial intelligence (ai) technologies to automate manual processes like data abstraction, data entry, patient communication, and ACR Lung Cancer Screening Registry submissions, allowing your clinical teams to focus on improving patient care navigation and patient outcomes.

Identify & Screen More At-Risk Patients
Accurately identify patients eligible for an initial or annual lung cancer screening with one click; allowing focus to be on the patients by freeing FTE time.

Automate & Simplify Workflow
Automatically populate all ACR Registry submission fields and deliver to the ACR with one click.

Increase Program Effectiveness
Provides incidental findings, missed appointment, over-due annual screening and over-due follow-up diagnostic management lists. 

Engage Patients & Providers
Automated letter/postcard generation and mailing provides education, screening results and reminds patients of annual screening eligibility. 

Automated Pulmonary Nodule Tracking
NODULE NAV

With Thynk Health’s Nodule Nav, healthcare organizations can improve follow up care from 29% to 100% with automated tracking of patients within a healthcare organization’s lung cancer screening program. Thynk Health processes radiology reports, extracting number of nodules, nodule size, location, and nodule characteristics. Combined with patient age and history, this information is a significant predictor of lung cancer (research). The clinical team will be able to automatically track nodule changes within each appointment, flag nodules for follow-up, and recommend next steps. All of this is accomplished via artificial intelligence, allowing radiologists to keep traditional workflow in place and require no additional work."

Currently, property managers input data from thousands of handwritten affordable housing applications with each open waitlist. Countless hours are spent deciphering handwriting, and inputting data into both Excel and property management software. 

By adding an ""apply now"" button on their website, properties can offer an online application powered by Haven Connect. This allows digitally savvy applicants to apply online, while ensuring that paper applications are still accepted. This enables property managers to lower their data entry requirements while ensuring equity for applicants who are unable to apply online."

The Leostream Difference
At Leostream, we take great pride in knowing that we are the world's premier and most comprehensive Remote Desktop Access Platform. This is because we believe everyone deserves a seamless work-from-anywhere environment, regardless of industry, size, or location. 

With the Leostream platform, it all starts with insight paired with simplicity. Powered by a single-pane-of-glass admin console, our platform simplifies the management of users, cloud desktops, and IT assets—all with real-time dashboard access to view usage and environment details, helping to make informed decisions.

More so, we also pride ourselves on our unique corporate culture. Our team members are forever-passionate about solving problems and are excited to work with customers to find the best solutions for their needs. 

This dedication also ensures that fit is always more important than tech savviness—meaning we look for individuals with intellectual curiosity and a passion for learning, knowing full well that we can always teach our team members the technical skills they need. 

Lastly, our technology is constantly evolving, driven by customer feedback and our commitment to their success. This feedback drives us to invest in solutions that meet our customer's needs, continually offering solutions that keep them ahead of the curve. 

This is accomplished by keeping a constant pulse on the remote desktop landscape, anticipating future states long before they arrive, to ensure that our clients are always prepared for what's next.
