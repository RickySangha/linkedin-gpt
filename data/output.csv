Property managers build their portfolios when they focus on growth activities. Handling maintenance issues interrupts from that and can cause stagnation in portfolio growth. Even worse, when it interrupts a good night's sleep and leads to an unproductive day. Property managers choose Latchel because instead of waking you up at 3am, your tenant calls Latchel. We take your tenant through an emergency diagnostic process and then troubleshoot their issue over the phone to prevent an unnecessary visit from a contractor. We are the ONLY maintenance coordinators with a patent pending technology that improves our accuracy and ability to help tenants resolve emergency issues fast.

If we determine that your tenant is having a true emergency, we'll dispatch the best vendor for the job. We dispatch immediately and our vendors do the minimum amount of work necessary to prevent property damage or fix habitability issues.

What qualifies as an emergency?
1. Leaks that cause property damage
2. No functioning toilets in the house
3. No heat in cold weather (under 45F; 55F if young children, elderly, or sick people are present)
4. No AC in hot weather (over 95F; 85F if young children, elderly, or sick people are present)
5. Security and safety issues (broken windows, open doors)
6. Electrical outages, not caused by the power company, and loss of power to medical equipment

ICG uses single-family home investments, bought in advantageous locations and the best U.S. markets. The houses are bought using as little as 15% down payments for qualified investors. Some of the loans obtained on these houses are fixed-rate (which means the loan payment never changes with the cost of living – even though everything else does!). This combination of leverage and fixed-rate financing helps you build a bigger estate faster and safer.

One of the first questions we get is ""Who will own the house?"" and the answer is simple: You.

ICG will connect you with the realtors we use ourselves. They can help you along with all the stages of buying: from identifying and presenting the best properties, to assistance with the loan qualifying process, to using ICG's preferred local property managers who can take care of all rental and maintenance aspects of ownership.

ICG enables you to enjoy the clout that comes from purchasing a multitude of houses, even if you only buy one. This stems from many investors giving business to the realtors and managers – you get the power of being part of the large group although you are an individual (best of both worlds)!

PLUS Property Management OR,http://www.investoregon.com,Real Estate,11-50 employees,"Bend, OR",Self-Owned,2003,N/A,"In my 30 plus years in the property management business I think it is accurate to say that this is the most challenging time I have ever experienced. With unemployment exceeding twenty percent paired with frustration and fear for both landlords and tenants being at an all-time high, Property Managers are more crucial than ever. Both landlords and tenants look to their property management company for reputable guidance.
 I must add, it has been heartwarming to see how tenants and landlords seem to understand the other side of the equation. PLUS has collected over 88% of the scheduled rents due. Now, that does not mean there are no hardships among our tenant population. There are numerous true hardships; cases of delayed unemployment checks, sudden job losses, tenants being denied eligibility for unemployment benefits and people borrowing money from their families in order to pay rent. My faith in humanity has truly been restored. Many of our tenants reached out to us prior to their rent’s due date if they knew they would be late. Some of our owners worked out rent deferral terms; not forgiving rent but agreeing to payments on unpaid rents due. The majority of owners have mortgages on their rental property and need the rent to pay these mortgages. Some owners agreed to wait for rent payment until the tenants’ stimulus checks arrived. Most owners waived late fees if the rent was paid in full. This is unchartered territory for the average owner and tenant and the fear of uncertainty is their enemy. The key to keeping the hysteria down is open and honest communication. 
Before the first of each month, we field frequent calls from tenants asking for assistance if they cannot make their full rent payment. We have found our tenants to be very responsible in getting their rent paid in a timely fashion and have not experienced too many issues despite the COVID Pandemic and the unemployment rate across the United States. 
We are thankful for you. Sincerely, Lawnae Hunter",

Our mission is to be a reliable, repeatable data collection partner.  For life.

We leverage direct connections into 250+ panel suppliers across 100+ countries.  Suppliers compete against each other for access to open quotas.  On average, a dozen panels will supply into an individual project.  This means: unbiased sample sourcing, more representative sample, faster turnaround time, more cost effective pricing, and more reach than traditional panel vendors.  

The foundation of quality in the research process is the sample itself. To continue with our unbiased theme, Rep Data partners with external consultants to rate our sample suppliers on an ongoing basis. We don't want to grade our own homework.  Each Rep Data supplier must meet a minimum quality benchmark, similar to how an Airbnb host must maintain a rating to list their property. Suppliers are graded on respondent attentiveness, time spent taking survey, straight-lining, open-end response quality, and attitudes over time.

To complement the sample quality, we also implement strict quality checks before, during, and after field.

The Struggle is Real
Another day and we lost more work orders in the shuffle. Another resident left because of shoddy service and another vacancy was extended because the make ready tasks weren’t complete. We needed a tool to improve our maintenance workflow, but couldn’t find software that met our needs. The existing property management software programs required extensive training and lacked the basic features we needed.

> We wanted an intuitive yet comprehensive platform that requires no training.
> We needed the ability to work anywhere, at any time, and on any device.
> We hoped for more automation in our workflow to lessen errors and delays.
> We wanted all the information and data we needed available with the tap of a finger.

We couldn’t find what we wanted, so we created it instead.

OUR FOUNDERS
Who are “we”? Michael Katz and Sean Landsberg.
Michael has decades of experience in multifamily as an investor, owner, and operator. Michael pushes the boundaries of “what’s been done” and explores “what could be”. Sean has extensive hands-on experience in multifamily management, overseeing the daily operations of a large company. Sean is passionate about technology, believing in its ability to solve real-world problems.

They spent years building, testing, and improving this app. They discovered what property managers needed; they figured out what worked and what didn’t and they learned which parts of maintenance and operations were priorities. After years of hard work, they realized they had something unique to share—something that would revolutionize the multifamily industry.

Michael and Sean built software with a proven model. Starting in 2021, they started sharing this business model with other property managers. They get it. Your problems are their problems. They are working to better the lives of your teams and their teams combined.",
